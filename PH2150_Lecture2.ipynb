    "The *Python* interpreter ignores the contents of a line after the # symbol, this allows the programmer to add useful comments to remind themselves or explain to others what particular lines of code are supposed to be doing. It is good practice to include comments at the beginning of your programs to explain what the program does, attribute the author and record details of date and version of the program. This may seem unnecessary for the 3-line codes that you will be writing at the beginning of the course but it is a good habit to form. The comment can appear at any point in the line, after encountering the # *Python* moves onto interpreting the next line. If you want a comment to span multiple lines you can either start each line with a #, or begin the block of commenting with \"\"\" ....add multi-line comments and then end with \"\"\", python will skip everything between (this type of comment is used for the special case of the function docstring describrd in chapter 3)"

Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by *keys*, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be *keys*. Tuples can be used as keys if they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples. You can not use lists as keys.\n",
    "It is best to think of a *dictionary* as an unordered set of *key:value* pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary, {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with <span style=\"color:blue\">del</span>. If you store using a key that is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten.\n",
    "The <span style=\"color:blue\">keys()</span> method of a dictionary object returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary, in arbitrary order (if you want it sorted, just apply the <span style=\"color:blue\">sorted()</span> function to it). To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the <span style=\"color:blue\">in</span> keyword.\n"
