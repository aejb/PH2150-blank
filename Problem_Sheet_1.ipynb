The computers in the teaching lab have several version of Python installed and as we will see it can be used in different ways. When we return to onsite lab sessions we will be using the Anaconda installation, with a Python 3.x version. However for now we will use the CoCalc.com cloud based servers accessed through a web browser.\n",
